# AIScreen Script

## Overview
The `AIScreen.py` script utilizes the `cv2` module (OpenCV) to perform screen-based operations, likely involving computer vision tasks. This README provides guidance on setting up the script, understanding its purpose, and resolving common issues.

## Features
- Screen Processing: The script processes and interacts with screen data.
- Computer Vision Tasks: Uses OpenCV (`cv2`) for image manipulation, processing, or analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or later
- Required libraries:
  - `opencv-python` (provides the `cv2` module)

## Setup

1. Install Python  
   Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Dependencies  
   Use `pip` to install the required library:  
   ```
   python3.12 -m pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. Clone or Download the Script  
   Download or clone the repository containing the `AIScreen.py` script:  
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

4. Run the Script  
   Execute the script from the command line:  
   ```
   python3.12 .\AIScreen.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'`  
This error occurs when the OpenCV library is not installed. To fix this, install the required library:  
```
python3.12 -m pip install opencv-python
```

### Error: `Python is not recognized as an internal or external command`  
Ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH. Reinstall Python and check the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

## How It Works  
The script likely:  
- Imports `cv2` for screen or image manipulation.  
- Processes screen data to analyze, display, or manipulate visual information.  

Check the script's inline comments for more specific functionality.
